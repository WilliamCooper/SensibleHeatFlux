# SensibleHeatFlux
Effects of temperature-sensor response on measurements of sensible heat flux

This repository contains work toward a journal article on measuring sensible heat flux using airborne thermometers. It contains a PDF-format working draft of that paper, the RMarkdown code that generates that draft, and a Workflow description to facilitate reproducibility.
