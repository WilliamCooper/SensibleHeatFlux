@article{FuehrerEtAl1994,
	abstract = { Abstract An analytical study was conducted of the thermal frequency response of an atmospheric temperature probe consisting of a thermistor bead with two lead wires soldered to thin support posts. Such probes are used in aircraft temperature sensors and for surface-layer turbulence studies. The results show the effects of the lead wires on the frequency response (amplitude and phase) of the probe for two end conditions of the lead wires: 1) fixed temperature at the mean free-stream value, and 2) adiabatic. For the smallest commercially available thermistor bead of approximately 200-{\textmu}m diameter and for 20-{\textmu}m-diameter platinum lead-wire lengths of about 0.8 mm, the conduction to the supports was found to be minimal for both end conditions. It was determined, however, that the lead wires themselves act as heat transfer fins and actually improve the frequency response over that of an ideal isolated bead. Model calculations show that the inclusion of multiple lead wires (four and six) connected mechanically, but not electrically or thermally, to supports would further improve the response. The thermal analysis is also applied to small type-E thermocouple junctions made of 12.5-, 25-, and 50-{\textmu}m- diameter wires, and the results show that the lead wires also improve the frequency response. },

	abstract = { Abstract Airborne resistance wire temperature sensors can introduce a time lag before ambient air temperature changes are registered. It has been found that a second-order linear response system adequately describes the behavior of the Rosemount non-deiced 102 series instrument consisting of a platinum resistance wire sensor with a protective housing. A method has been proposed in the literature to deconvolve measured temperatures based on this system to obtain the ambient temperature. Using the exact solution of the underlying differential equation formulation of that method, a more efficient and more accurate correction algorithm is developed here. As with its predecessor, this new algorithm can be applied to temperature data obtained in dry conditions and so is suitable for dry boundary layer but not in-cloud measurements. },

@article{LawsonRodi1992,
	abstract = { Abstract A new airborne thermometer has been designed using results from numerical simulators of airflow and particle (drop) trajectories. Initial flight tests with the NCAR King Air show that the new thermometer, which uses a fine-wire thermocouple for the sensor and lacks a probe housing, has a response time that is significantly faster than thermometers currently in use. An example of heat-flux calculations in a convective boundary layer shows that, compared to measurements using the Rosemount thermometer and NCAR K probes, the turbulent heat flux is greater by about 20\% when using measurements from the new thermometer. Theoretical calculations of time response support the claim that the improved response is due to the absence of a probe housing. The new thermometer was designed to inertially separate cloud drops from the airflow, and flights in warm clouds suggest that the thermocouple sensor stays dry except in clouds that contain high concentrations of drizzle-size drops. In small cumulus clouds with approximately 1 g m−3 of liquid water that contained low concentrations (∼10 l−1) of drizzle drops, the new thermocouple probe consistently measured warmer temperatures than the reverse-flow and Rosemount thermometers, suggesting that in these clouds the thermocouple probe may not have been affected by errors from sensor wetting. Thus, static temperature measured by the new thermometer in clouds with continental drop spectra should be reliable. An example of data collected in a mixed region of a small cumulus cloud shows that there may be more temperature structure at scales of 2--50 m than previously observed. },

@article{PayneEtAl1994,
	abstract = { Abstract The heat transfer characteristics of an aircraft-mounted resistance-wire atmospheric temperature sensor are modeled to determine the time and frequency responses. The sensor element (Rosemount 102E4AL) consists of a 25-\ensuremath{\mu}m-diameter platinum wire wound around a cruciform mica support with approximately 143 diameters of wire between contacts with the mica. A longitudinally distributed, radially lumped capacitance model provided for the convective heat transfer to the wire and the transient heat conduction along it. Similarly, the temperature gradient across the thin dimension of the mica support was neglected, and a radially distributed model provided for the convective heat transfer to the mica and the transient conduction within it. The two solutions are coupled by the boundary conditions at the wire-mica contact. The equations were solved to produce the temperature distribution along the wire and in the mica support as a function of the frequency of a free-stream sinusoidal temperature fluctuation. The frequency response transfer function was determined and fit to a two-time-constant transfer function by regression analysis. The two-time-constant model fits the general solution very well. The small (fast response) time constant is essentially determined by the wire itself. The larger (slow response) time constant is due to conduction into and out of the mica supports. The model predicts that the effects of the mica supports are important for frequencies greater than about 0.1 Hz. The responses to five different temperature waveform inputs (sinusoid, step, pulse, ramp, and ramp level) are derived using the two-time-constant model with Laplace transform techniques for both infinite-length wire (no mica support effects) and the finite-length wire of the 102 probe. The actual temperature signals are distorted by the larger time constant of the mica supports, especially for the pulse and ramp inputs that are typical of aircraft measurements of thermals and inversions. },

	abstract = {The HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) programme has completed three of five planned aircraft transects spanning the Pacific from 85 {\textdegree} N to 67 {\textdegree} S, with vertical profiles every approximately 2.2 {\textdegree} of latitude. Measurements include greenhouse gases, long-lived tracers, reactive species, O(2)/N(2) ratio, black carbon (BC), aerosols and CO(2) isotopes. Our goals are to address the problem of determining surface emissions, transport strength and patterns, and removal rates of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols at global scales and to provide strong tests of satellite data and global models. HIPPO data show dense pollution and BC at high altitudes over the Arctic, imprints of large N(2)O sources from tropical lands and convective storms, sources of pollution and biogenic CH(4) in the Arctic, and summertime uptake of CO(2) and sources for O(2) at high southern latitudes. Global chemical signatures of atmospheric transport are imaged, showing remarkably sharp horizontal gradients at air mass boundaries, weak vertical gradients and inverted profiles (maxima aloft) in both hemispheres. These features challenge satellite algorithms, global models and inversion analyses to derive surface fluxes. HIPPO data can play a crucial role in identifying and resolving questions of global sources, sinks and transport of atmospheric gases and aerosols.},

	abstract = {{This paper proposes a method that uses an aircraft with a single-antenna GPS receiver and Pitot tube to estimate wind speed and direction and to calibrate the airspeed. This sensor combination alone does not determine the true attitude of the aircraft, so the wind parameters cannot be obtained directly from the measurements. However, if the aircraft flies at different headings, such as in banking turns or circle maneuvers, the wind magnitude and direction can be estimated from the geometrical relation between the wind and the measurements. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to estimate wind parameters. The EKF can also estimate the scaling factor used to convert dynamic pressure to airspeed. This is useful for the operation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) because of difficulty in determining the airspeed scaling factor of a low-cost UAV. Simulations are performed for a constant 2-D wind. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, flight tests of a small UAV are conducted. Simulations and flight test results show that the proposed method is effective.}},

	abstract = {{The accurate measurement of both air velocity and volumetric airflow can be accomplished using a Pitot tube, a differential pressure transducer, and a computer system which includes the necessary hardware and software to convert the raw transducer signals into the proper engineering units. The incorporation of sensors to measure the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity can further increase the accuracy of the velocity and flow measurements. The Pitot tube measures air velocity directly by means of a pressure transducer which generates an electrical signal which is proportional to the difference between the pressure generated by the total pressure and the still air (static pressure). The volumetric flow is then calculated by measuring the average velocity of an air stream passing through a passage of a known diameter. When measuring volumetric how, the `passage of a known diameter' must be designed to reduce air turbulence as the air mass flows over the Pitot tube. Also, the placement of the pitot tube in the passage will influence how accurately the measured flow tracks the actual Bow through the passage. Calibrating the measurement system in a wind tunnel can further increase the accuracy of the velocity and the flow measurements. This objective of this paper is to provide the field engineer with single, concise source of information on Bow measurement using a Pitot tube. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

@article{WangGeertz2009,
	abstract = {{Airborne reverse flow immersion thermometers were designed to prevent
   sensor wetting in cloud. Yet there is strong evidence that some wetting
   does occur and therefore also sensor evaporative cooling as the aircraft
   exits a cloud. Numerous penetrations of cumulus clouds in a broad range
   of environmental and cloud conditions are used to estimate the resulting
   negative temperature bias. This cloud exit ``cold spike{''} can be found
   in all cumulus clouds, even at subfreezing temperatures, both in
   continental and maritime cumuli. The magnitude of the spike correlates
   most strongly with the dryness of the ambient air. A temperature
   correction based on this relationship is proposed. More important than
   the cloud exit cold spike, from a cumulus dynamics perspective, is the
   negative bias within cloud. Such bias is expected, due to evaporative
   cooling as well. Evaporation from the wetted sensor in cloud is surmised
   because air decelerates into the thermometer housing, and thus is heated
   and becomes subsaturated. Thus an in-cloud temperature correction is
   proposed, based on the composite cloud exit evaporative cooling
   behavior. This correction leads to higher and more realistic estimates
   of cumulus buoyancy and lower estimates of entrainment.}},

The laser radiation, which is assumed to have a wavefront with a gaussian amplitude distribution, is transmitted into the atmosphere through a telescope. Radiation is collected by the same telescope and directed onto a detector where it is mixed with a local oscillator beam originating from the same laser source. The signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the detector is calculated under shot noise limited conditions. The calculation is general and applies for both near and far fields and for focused and unfocused systems. Three specific cases are considered.

@article{albrecht2019CSET,
	abstract = { AbstractThe Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) study was designed to describe and explain the evolution of the boundary layer aerosol, cloud, and thermodynamic structures along trajectories within the North Pacific trade winds. The study centered on seven round trips of the National Science Foundation--National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF--NCAR) Gulfstream V (GV) between Sacramento, California, and Kona, Hawaii, between 7 July and 9 August 2015. The CSET observing strategy was to sample aerosol, cloud, and boundary layer properties upwind from the transition zone over the North Pacific and to resample these areas two days later. Global Forecast System forecast trajectories were used to plan the outbound flight to Hawaii with updated forecast trajectories setting the return flight plan two days later. Two key elements of the CSET observing system were the newly developed High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Cloud Radar (HCR) and the high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL). Together they provided unprecedented characterizations of aerosol, cloud, and precipitation structures that were combined with in situ measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and turbulence properties. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus infused with smoke from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale cloud--precipitation complexes, and patches of shallow cumuli in very clean environments. Ultraclean layers observed frequently near the top of the boundary layer were often associated with shallow, optically thin, layered veil clouds. The extensive aerosol, cloud, drizzle, and boundary layer sampling made over open areas of the northeast Pacific along 2-day trajectories during CSET will be an invaluable resource for modeling studies of boundary layer cloud system evolution and its governing physical processes. },

	abstract = {{In this study, an integral approach of the boundary layer analysis is employed to investigate fluid flow around and heat transfer from an infinite circular cylinder. The Von Karman--Pohlhausen method is used to solve momentum integral equation and the energy integral equation is solved for both isothermal and isoflux boundary conditions. A fourth-order velocity profile in the hydrodynamic boundary layer and a third-order temperature profile in the thermal boundary layer are used to solve both integral equations. Closed form expressions are obtained for the drag and the average heat transfer coefficients which can be used for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The results for both drag and heat transfer coefficients are in good agreement with experimental/numerical data for a circular cylinder.}},
